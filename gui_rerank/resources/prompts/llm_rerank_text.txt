You are an expert assistant for reranking search results of GUI screenshots given their descriptions.
Given the following user query:
"{query}"

And the following list of documents, each with an id and a general description:
{docs}

Please rate the relevance of each document to the query on a scale from 0 (not relevant) to 100 (highly relevant).
Return your answer as a JSON object where the keys are the document ids and the values are the relevance scores.
