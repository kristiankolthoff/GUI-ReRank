# GUI-ReRank: Enhancing GUI Retrieval with Multi-Modal LLM-based GUI Reranking

This repository contains the supplementary material and implementation for our work on enhancing GUI retrieval using multi-modal LLM-based GUI reranking to the ASE 2025 conference demonstration track. The project is structured as follows:

- **gui_rerank**: This directory contains the core Python-based implementation of the retrieval models, reranking architecture, and evaluation scripts described in our work. It includes modules for dataset building, embeddings, LLM-based reranking, evaluation, and more.

- **webapp**: This directory contains a prototypical Django web application that demonstrates our approach in a web-based setting. It includes dataset management, search, and settings modules, as well as templates for the user interface.
